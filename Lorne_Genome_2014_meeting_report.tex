%% Background %%
%%

The $35^{th}$ Annual Lorne Genome Conference attracted scientists from around Australia and internationally to the Victorian Surf Coast town of Lorne for 3 days of genomics by the beach. The diversity of genomics research was on show across the 35 talks ($43\%$ by women) and more than 250 poster presentations. Thomas Preiss (Australian National University, Australia) was awarded the Julian Wells medal in recognition of his research in RNA biology and for his support of the Lorne Genome conference. Prizes were also given to Geoff Faulkner (Mater Medical Research Institute, Australia), Daniela Quintana (Massey University, New Zealand), Laura Norton (University of New South Wales, Australia), Farrah El-Saffin (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Australia) and Sam Buckberry (Robinson Institute, Australia) in a session dedicated to young researchers and students.

 \textbf{TODO: }In summarising the meeting, we have chosen to focus on presentations \textbf{$\ldots$}

\textbf{TODO:} I'm rather aware that most of the talks I've discussed are from "big name" international speakers - not great. But these are the talks (a) I found most interesting, (b) have the best notes on so can fairly summarise and (c) only 15/35 talks were given by people working in Aus/NZ, of which 4 were student prize talks.

\section*{Australian stuff}
Australia is home to many unique animals and plant species. \textbf{Examples. How their genomes are useful. Segue into Henrik's and Katherine's talks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Henrik Kaessmann on mammalian transcriptomes (PH: missed this talk)
	\item Katherine Belov mammalian venoms
\end{itemize}

\section*{Disease and Medical Genomics}
Elaine Mardis (The Genome Institute at Washington University, USA) gave a wonderful opening keynote presentation on translating cancer genomics research into clinical care. Mardis described how her team integrate whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). She emphasised the extra information that RNA-seq provides, as they find that only $40\%$ of mutated genes are expressed in the tumour (\textbf{in what context? Cancer generally or was she talking about a specific cancer at this point?}). Aside from the challenges of integrating multiple data sources, Mardis also described how these results are then presented to the Washington University School of Medicine's Tumour Board. The training of physicians in understanding the strengths of limitations of genomics research is criticial, Mardis told the audience, and described 3 (\textbf{or 4?}) cases presented to the review board. Not only were these fascinating examples of translating cancer genomics into clinical practice, but they also drew shocked laughs from the audience about the realities of the American health care system. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Another presentation in this theme?
	\item Matt Brown
\end{itemize}



\section*{Epigenomics and Chromatin}
Epigenomics and the higher-order organisation of the genome were the theme of several presentations. Bing Ren (University of San Diego School of Medicine, USA) spoke about detecting enhancers and re-constructing the 3-dimensional structure of the genome using the chromatin-conformation-capture technology, Hi-C. Ren showed that Hi-C has more strings to its proverbial bow and described his group's (\textbf{? and others?}) recent foray into using Hi-C for long-range haplotyping of genome. Resolving haplotypes is still a difficult problem, particularly in human genetics where most sequencing is done using Illumina's short read technology. Haplotyping by Hi-C, along with recent improvements in throughput by Pacific Biosciences' longer read technology and Illumina's commercialisation of the Moleculo technology, are helping to "close the gap".

Wendy Bickmore (University of Edinburgh, UK) presented data showing that the most active regions of genomes are often found in the centre of the nucleus whereas the nuclear periphery is occupied by gene-poor, inactive chromosomal domains. Bickmore described recent experiments that seek to determine whether it is the genomic structure that dictates function or the function that dictates the structure by perturbing either the nuclear organisation or transcription.

Joe Ecker (Salk Institute, USA) took us from the world of human genomes to the world of the plant genomes and back again, in his talk on DNA methylation. \emph{Arabidopsis Thaliana}
